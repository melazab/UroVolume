# UroVolume
This project involves adding volume sensing to the UroMonitor, using the electrical conductance (mS) of urine.
Given the physiological variation in urine concentration depending on a person's hydration level, a method of estimating the conductivity of urine (mS/cm) must be taken into consideration.
This repository contains MATLAB scripts to analyze Volume (and possibly Pressure) data from the Uromonitor.
